            Personally, I derive satisfaction seeing that I am able to learn with a
            hands on approach to knowledge acqusition and implementation. Being a
            student myself, i would jump at the opportunty to be part of a learning
            community whose core values align with my expectations of how a learning
            process should be implemented. I strongly beleive that studying at
            Altschool will provide an opportunity to learn and braoden my
            analytical, inter personal communication skills and the understanding of
            Backend Engineering, its concepts and implementation.
